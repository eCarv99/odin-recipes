    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This recipe has no added sugar so it is great for Diabetics.<br>
        It is a favorite in our house.</p>
    <p>I first tried this recipe as a regular dessert and later tried<br>
        it without sugar and found it to be just as good.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/3 cups of graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 (.6 ounce) package sugar free lemon flavored Jell-O</li>
        <li>1 cup boiling water</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package reduced fat cream cheese</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen light whipped topping, thawed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps to prepare</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl,<br>
            combine graham cracker crumbs, butter and cinnamon. Mix well and<br>
            press into the bottom of a 9 inch square pan. Bake in preheated<br>
            oven for 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to cool.</li>
        <li>Dissolve lemon gelatin in boiling water. Let cool until thickened,<br>
            but not set. In a large bowl, beat cream cheese and vanilla until<br>
            smooth. Blend in lemon gelatin. Fold in whipped topping.</li>
        <li>Pour filling into crust. Sprinkle top with graham cracker crumbs.<br>
            Refrigerate over night.</li>
    </ol>
