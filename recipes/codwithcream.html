    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This Creamy Baked Cod Recipe is light and flaky, with a savory<br>
        creamy sauce that puts this dish over the top.</p>
    <p>It's hands-down, my favorite fish dish and it turns out perfectly<br>
        every time.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cod fillets</li>
        <li>Garlic and salt</li>
        <li>Melted butter</li>
        <li>Seasoned breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Butter and cornstarch</li>
        <li>Cream and milk</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps to prepare</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Make a Roux:</strong> Prepare the cream sauce by making a roux out<br>
            of melted butter and cornstarch.</li>
        <li><strong>Prepare the Sauce:</strong> Whisk in whipping cream and milk until well<br>
            combined. Stir in the Parmesan cheese. Reduce heat to low and stir occasionally<br>
            while sauce thickens to a rich, creamy sauce. Add more milk if needed. The<br>
            consistency should be similar to a thin gravy. Season with salt and pepper. Set<br>
            aside while you prepare the fish.</li>
        <li><strong>Baste Fish with Garlic Butter:</strong> Spray a baking dish with cooking<br>
            spray then add fish and season with salt. Melt butter and garlic together and<br>
            brush it over the fish.</li>
        <li><strong>Season the Fish:</strong> Sprinkle each fillet with seasoned breadcrumbs<br>
            then add any remaining melted butter over the top. This will help bake all that<br>
            buttery flavor into the fish.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Cream Sauce:</strong> Pour cream sauce in the spaces between the fish,<br>
            leaving the tops of the fish visible in the pan.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Bake at 400Â°F for 25-30 minutes. The cream sauce should be<br>
            bubbling and the tops of the fish a golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
