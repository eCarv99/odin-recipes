    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Homemade rib marinade is used in this barbecue ribs recipe that's easier than it looks.</p>
    <p>I usually cook the ribs the day before and grill them for a quick dinner the next night.</p>
    <p>The sauce is much better after it is cooked; it is not a dipping sauce.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 pounds pork spareribs</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chile sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup ketchup</li>
        <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 Worcerstershire sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup rum</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dry mustard</li>
        <li>1 dash ground black pepper</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps to prepare</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Cut spareribs into serving size portions; wrap in double thickness of foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 1 Â½ hours. Unwrap and drain drippings.<br>
            (I usually freeze drippings to use later in soups.) Place ribs in a large<br>
            roasting pan.</li>
        <li>Mix brown sugar, chile sauce, ketchup, soy sauce, Worcestershire sauce, rum,<br>
            garlic, mustard, and pepper together in a bowl. Coat ribs with sauce and marinate<br>
            at room temperature for 1 hour or refrigerate for 8 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat the grill to medium heat. Position the grate 4 inches above heat source;<br>
            grease the grate with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Cook ribs on the preheated grill for 30 minutes, basting with marinade.</li>
    </ol>
